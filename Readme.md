        It'll either render external or internal component,
        the component will be entirely build using client side Javascript, rather than

                -> renderSpace() fucntion, which will in turns call 
                        A. showSpace -> render space-render section
                                1. showInterior() -> Interior markup 
                                2. showExterior() -> Exterior markup
